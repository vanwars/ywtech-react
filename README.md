# Installation

Install dependencies by navigating to the `ywtech-react` folder on your CLI and running the following:

```bash
npm install
```

# Running Your React App Locally
Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Deploying to GitHub Pages
If you want to deploy to GitHub pages (as a live website):

1. Create a new GitHub repo and push this `ywtech-react` code to your repo.
2. Run the following deployment script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command runs a third-party script called `gh-pages`, which builds your react code, and then pushes it to a new branch called `gh-pages` (you can take a look once you run the command on GitHub).

Here's a [demo](https://vanwars.github.io/ywtech-react/) of what it should look like. Make sure your repo is a public repo or your GitHub pages won't work (unless you have an .EDU or paid account).
